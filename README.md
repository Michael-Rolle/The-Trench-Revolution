# The-Trench-Revolution
2d real time strategy ww1 game where your objective is to manage your points to spawn troops that will defeat the enemy troops and destroy their base before they destroy yours.

When you start the game there will be buttons on the bottom left side of the screen that spawn in different types of troops when pressed.
From left to right the different troops are:
-rifleman
-shotgunner
-sniper
-machinegunner
-tank
Each troop has a different cost associated with it just above its button icon. A troop is available to spawn when the cost value above its button icon is lit yellow.
This cost value will be white when the troop is still on cooldown after recently being spawned.

You can see how much money you have at the top left of the screen. It will slowly increase with time and you will also earn money by defeating enemy troops.
When you spawn in a specific troop the amount it costs to spawn the troop will be subtracted from your total amount.

Each troop has different stats and offer different advantages and disadvantages. For example, the sniper is accurate and can shoot from far away but has a long reload
time and has little health.

It is up to the player to determine which troops are best to spawn to defeat the never-ending waves of enemy troops.
